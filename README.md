StarlingVideoExample
====================

A simple example demonstrating StageVideo under a Starling stage.

If StageVideo is not available, the demo uses a standard AS3 Video object.

The example intends to show how the stage3D stage needs to be made invisible before StageVideo can be seen underneath.

The video provided in the example is from Lee Brimelow's tutorial on StageVideo:
